# COVID-19 Tracker
## About The Project
The COVID-19 tracker website is a personal project that was inspired by a Java mobile app project built during one of my university class. I had took the main idea from that project and decided to convert it to a website that is accessible on all platforms, rather than confined to an Android phone. I have also added additional features to make mine more interesting.

As the COVID-19 is still prevalent today, keeping track of country's case numbers is relevant for either personal interests or statistical analysis. This website gathers its data from a third-party API called [covid19api](https://covid19api.com/), a free to use API that generates relevant corona virus data of all countries in the world. The COVID-19 tracker is then able to display all countries in a list format, allowing users to click on each to view more information on that particular country. Users are able to search and sort the list to find their desired country more easily. Users are also able to favourite frequently viewed countries so that their data is displayed at the top and is saved into local storage.
